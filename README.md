# blogSite
A website built with node, express, and ejs. 

I think this might be my biggest personal project to date. 

this is a "Blog website", in which a user can post various text articles. 

to Run: [need to have node installed] 

1) clone/ download zip of repo 
2) open in code editor of choice 
3) in terminal/command line run npm i in location of folder (I prefer to use terminal in VS code or hyper terminal) 
4) once the node_modules are downloaded you can simply enter "node app.js" in terminal 
5) you will be greeted with a message "server running on port 3010" [you can change port variable on ln 6] 
6) go to the localhost and there you go !

// looking to have the project be hosted somewhere as soon as I have a "complete" version
